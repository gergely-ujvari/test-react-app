# Test application

## Description
Simple test application

## Setup
The application will install itself if the `make` command is available.

Simply running `make` (or `make dev`) is enough.

The process will install meteor using the [official install script](https://install.meteor.com/). This is the traditional way to install meteor. Recently a global [meteor npm install package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meteor) is also available to reach the same result, but that is more obtrusive.

## Technical information
### Code & Quality
 - The application is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
 - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is used to improve code quality (`make eslint`)
 - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for consistent code style (`make check-code-format` and `make format-code`)
 - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for UI testing (`make cypress-cli` and `make cypress`)

### Application tech stack
- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) (which is node.js based) is used as the backend both for the Rest endpoints and for hosting the frontend code.
- [Simple:Json-routes](https://meteor-rest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/json-routes/README/) for setting up the Rest endpoints
- [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) for generating test data
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building the frontend
- [antd](https://ant.design/) for styled components

## Possible Improvements
### UI
- Store the search params in the page url, what way the results could be shared.
- Debounce requests not to flood the backend with queries.
- Use a client-size state management library for storing the state (i.e. [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) or [Redux](https://redux.js.org/))
- Improve styling

### Backend
- Introduce more api endpoints to implement all [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete).
- Use a real db layer.
  - With Meteor [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is preferred because it has automatic reactivity and nearly zero backend code is required to have live data client side.
  - With other DBs [Apollo layer](https://www.apollographql.com/) is preferred with a proper GraphQL schema

### General
- Add authentication and a permission system
- Add proper logging.
- Generate valid data or more convincing test data
